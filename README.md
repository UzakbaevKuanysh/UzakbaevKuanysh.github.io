    <p>Hi all, my name is Kuanysh.I am begginer programmer and 3 year student in KBTU. My first year wasnt bad, but the second was awful.When the 3 semester started i didnt take the study serious.So it was bad.
        My gpa was down to 2.32 from 3.12 and i lost my schoolarship because of 60 points in Database.The same was with the 4 semester.
